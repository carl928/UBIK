# UpperBody IK (UBIK) #

UBIK is an Upper Body IK solution for VR inspired by Mathias Parger's master thesis http://diglib.tugraz.at/download.php?id=5c4a48dc5a282&location=browse
which was implemented in Unity and shared here: https://github.com/dabeschte/VRArmIK

## WORK IN PROGRESS ##
* Trying to convert the BP solution into an easy to use AnimNode, that contains all logic from AnimBP + UBIKComponent. This will make it much easier to reuse in multiple projects, and effectively make it plug-n-play.

### Features ###

* VR Upper Body based on two controllers and hmd
* 360deg movement
* Simple support for skeletal meshes
* Support for IK chain going from Pelvis and up
* Limited support for twist bones
